# The project is working and it is a very complex and beautiful work. 
# I see you have practised all the topics you have learnt. I love how you use db_params and that you hide it in gitignore. 
# But the best practice is to use .env for that. 
# Because .env has the same structure for everyone and your db_settings I have no idea about its structure. 

# I also like that you practised requests too!

# In the DB functions you forgot to create the table you are inserting into. 
# Like, if I dont have yout local DB on the computer it is really hard to recreate tables without it. 

# Apart from that, brilliant work! Congrats guys!
